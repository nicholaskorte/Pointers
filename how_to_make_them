//a pointer variable "points" to a place in the computer's memory where something is stored i.e. variable and functions
//you would use a pointer variable if is global and going to be changed throughout other functions.
//or if you are trying to get the contents of a vaariable outside of the function you are using
//create a pointer variable using a asterik (*)

#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
//below is a normal variable with the name of location and a return type of int
//this is not a pointer
  int location = 4;
//next we will create a pointer named new_location holding the address of location in the computer's memory, hence the ampersand
  int *new_location = &location;
//new_location is now equal to location

//next we will do what is called dereferencing a pointer. basically like getting the info the pointer is pointing to
  printf("%d", *new_location);// the %d will print out a number like %i. I dont know the difference but you can look it up
//we will only use the * for referencing pointers not normal variables. its like saying look at what its pointing at and then read it
}
